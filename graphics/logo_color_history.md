# Logo Color History

## Color Change Record

- **Previous color:** `#FA6800` (used for the logo before today)
- **New color:** `#2563EB` (chosen on 2025-06-19)

### Rationale
The original logo color (`#FA6800`) was selected as an initial branding choice. On 2025-06-19, the color was updated to `#2563EB` to better align with current design preferences. This change is recorded here for historical reference. In the future, we plan to revisit and refine the color palette with more deliberate consideration and design effort.
