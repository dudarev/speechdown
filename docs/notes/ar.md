File inspired by [The append-and-review note idea by Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/)

- If the `-d` (directory) option is not provided when running the CLI, it should default to using the current working directory (the directory from which the command is executed) as the target for processing audio files.

- ADR about research:
  - Define purpose
  - Location of research scripts
  - Record outcomes

- Research how to extract timestamps for audio files in two ways:
  1. From the filename: Investigate systematic methods to parse timestamps embedded in audio file names.
  2. From file metadata: Explore how to retrieve creation or recording timestamps from audio file metadata.
- The goal is to use these extracted timestamps to add accurate time information to markdown files.

- Start CHANGELOG.md

- âœ… Refactor handlers.py into smaller files (completed on 2025-05-17)

- When creating a design doc and mentioning tests there a reference to existing ADRs should should be made. I need to think where to put this thought either to the ADR about design docs or into the rules for the copilot. 

- By the way, how can I set up the rules for the copilot? 

- When instructing a copilot to create design doc it needs to be mentioned that it should should stop after the design doc created for me to review, edit it and give feedback. With language settings it was able to create the design doc and implement it. it was okay but in general this doesn't look like the right approach.

- **Speech Down Project Enhancements:**
  - **Efficient Language Detection:**
    - Transcribe only the first 10 seconds for initial language detection.
    - Iterate through languages, comparing partial transcriptions.
    - Initiate full transcription only after identifying the best language match.
  - **File Updates**
    - Update file after each transcription action.
    - If partial transcription finished, add to a dedicated section.
    - If better partial transcription found, update the section.
    - Full transcription will also update section.

- **Current goal: Publish and make usable**
- **Primary functionality needed:**
  - Transcribe daily notes in three different languages
  - Integrate with personal workflow (`cron`)
  - Support daily voice notes

- **Configuration for output mapping:**
  - Configure output directory via config file or command
  - Map speech notes to daily text files with timestamped H2 headers
  - Specify output path, filename prefixes/suffixes,templates
