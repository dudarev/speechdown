**Status:** Accepted
**Related ADRs:** [ADR 001](001_adrs_process.md).

## Context

To streamline the creation of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) using AI, a standardized prompt is needed to ensure clarity, conciseness, and consistency, while aligning with the overall process defined in [ADR 001](001_adrs_process.md).

## Decision

We will use the following prompt when creating ADRs:

**Prompt Template:**

"Create concise and clear Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Follow the structure defined in ADR 001.

Ensure that each section is brief and only includes necessary details."

## Consequences

- Consistency across all ADRs.
- Faster documentation and review cycles.
- Clear traceability and reduced verbosity in decision documentation.

## Conclusion

This standardized prompt will help generate concise ADRs and maintain alignment with our architectural decision process as defined in ADR 001.
