# ADR 001: Process for Creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Date:** 2025-03-02  
**Status:** Accepted
**Related ADRs:** [ADR 003](003_standardized_adr_prompt.md)

## Context

As the SpeechDown project evolves, we need a standardized way to document architectural decisions to maintain clarity and consistency in development.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) with the following structure:
- Location: `docs/adrs` directory
- File naming: `NNN_title.md` where NNN starts from 001
- Format: slightly modified [Michael Nygard's template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md), shown below:

```markdown
# Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Consequences

```

## Consequences

- Improved team communication through structured documentation
- Clear reference for new team members
- Traceable history of architectural decisions

## Conclusion

This ADR process will help maintain clear documentation of architectural decisions throughout the project's lifecycle.
